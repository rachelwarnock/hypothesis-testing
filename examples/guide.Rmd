Different tests available  : comparison, correlation, regression (cause and effect relationships).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#schedule
library(kableExtra)
dt <- data.frame(Research_question  = c("what?"),
                 variable = "1",
                 )

kbl(dt, align=c("l","c")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")

```
