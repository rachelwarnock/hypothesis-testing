# About this course

.large[
The course focuses on **statistical hypothesis testing** and **reproducibility** in science. 

You will learn:
* how develop and test your own hypotheses
* perform basic statistical tests 
* apply this knowledge to reproduce (and potentially improve) published results
]

.large[Each participant is assigned to a working and each group is assigned a published scientific paper.]

.large[On **a date to be decided** each group will present their findings.]

# Example

.large[
**Research question** $-$ What is the impact of continental configuration on extinction risk?]

]

```{r, echo=FALSE}

.large[

<br>

## Null vs. alternative hypotheses 

.large[
The **null hypothesis** $H_0$ is a concise statement expressing the concept of "no difference" between a sample and the population mean.

It corresponds to the exact opposite of the thing I want to believe!
]

--

.large[
The **alternative hypothesis** $H_1$ is the thing I'm actually interested in testing.
]

--

.large[
The goal is not to show that the alternative hypothesis is (probably) true, the goal is to show that the null hypothesis is (probably) false!
]

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#the null hypothesis is deemed to be true unless you, the researcher, can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it is false.

Discuss the hypotheses in your paper.

Try to identify the following:

* The alternative hypothesis
* The null hypothesis

Don't worry about getting it perfect, you can go back and refine it later.

## Sampling distributions

.large[
If the probability of being a .blue[blue] bird is $\theta = 0.5$, what would we expect the data to look like?
]

--

.large[
We can also say $X/N = 0.5$ (approximately). This is our **test statistic**.
] 

--

.large[
We need to determine what the **sampling distribution** of the test statistic would be if the null hypothesis was true. 
]

--

.large[
This distribution tells us what values we can expect if $H_0$ is true. We use this a tool to assess how closely the null agrees with our data.
]

---

class: middle

<center><img src="img/samplingdist1.png" alt="" height="500px" /></center>

The null hypothesis predicts that $X$ is [*binomially distributed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution).
It says $X = 50/100$ is the most likely outcome, so we'd expect to see somewhere between 40 and 60 .blue[blue] birds.

---

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Critical regions and critical values

.large[
$X$ should be very big or very small in order to reject the null hypothesis.]

--

.large[
If the null hypothesis is true, the sampling distribution of $X$ is Binomial $(0.5, N)$.
]

--

.large[
$\alpha$ is the significance level (c.f. *p*-values).
]

--

.large[
If $\alpha = 0.05$, the critical region must cover 5% of this sampling distribution.
]

---
class: middle center

<center><img src="img/samplingdist2.png" alt="" height="500px" /></center>

Our critical region consists of the most extreme values, known as the **tails** of the distribution.

---
class: middle

.pull-left[

<br>
<br>
<br>

.large[
The **critical region** corresponds to the values of $X$ for which we would reject the null hypothesis. 

The **sampling distribution** allows us to calculate the probability that we would obtain a particular value of $X$ if the null hypothesis were actually true.
]
]

.pull.right[

<img src="img/samplingdist2.png" alt="" height="400px" />

]

---
class: middle

.pull-left[

.large[
For $\alpha =$ .05, our critical regions correspond to  $X ≤$ 40 and $X≥$ 60.

The numbers 40 and 60 are our **critical values**.

If the number of blue birds is between 41 and 59, then we should retain the null hypothesis (birds have the same chance of being .blue[blue] as being .red[red]).

If the number of blue birds is between 0 to 40 **or** between 60 to 100, then we should reject the null hypothesis $-$ this is a **two tailed test**.

---
class: middle
## Statisical significance

.large[
If the data allow us to reject the null hypothesis, we say that "the result is statistically significant", which is often shortened to "the result is significant". 

This terminology reflects a time when "significant" meant something like "indicated", rather than its more recent meaning, which is closer to "important".
]

--
.large[
How do we define significance?
]
---
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Two types of errors

.large[
We **always** have to accept there's a chance that the results of any experiment are wrong.]

--

.large[
The goal behind statistical hypothesis testing is not to *eliminate* but to *minimize* errors.
]

---
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Two types of errors

.large[
After we run the test, one of four things might have happened:

* $H_0$ is true and we correctly accept the null

* $H_0$ is true and we **incorrectly** accept the null (type I error)

* $H_0$ is false and we correct reject the null

* $H_0$ is false and **incorrectly** reject the null (type II error)
]

---
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Two types of errors

.large[
If we reject a null hypothesis that is actually true, then we have a **type I error**.
]

--

.large[
If we retain the null hypothesis that is actually false, then we have a **type II error**.
]

--

.large[
One of the most important design principles of hypothesis testing is to control the probability $\alpha$ of a **type I error**. ]

--

.large[
$\alpha$ is called the significance level. By convention we often use $\alpha$ of 0.05, 0.01, 0.001.]

--

.large[
A hypothesis test that is said to have a significance level $\alpha$ has a type I error rate is no larger than $\alpha$.
]

# *p*-values

.pull-left[

*p* can be defined to be the smallest type I error rate $\alpha$ that you are willing to tolerate if you want to reject the null hypothesis.

In the bird example, $X=$ 62 .blue[blue] birds gives us 
*p* = 0.021. The results can be interpreted as shown in the table, given *p* = 0.021.

$X=$ 97 .blue[blue] birds would give us *p* = 1.36 X $10^{-25}$, which is a tiny, tiny type I error rate.

# *p*-values

Recall that the critical region corresponds to the tails (extremes) of the distribution. 

*p* can therefore also be defined as the probability of observing a test statistic that is (at least) as extreme as the one we actually get. 

If the data are extremely implausible according to the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is probably wrong.

# Reporting *p*-values

.large[
**Option 1** $-$ you can state only that *p* $< \alpha$ for a significance level that you chose in advance, e.g., *p<*.05.

But this means we're being forced to treat *p*=.051 in a fundamentally different way to *p*=.049.]

.large[
**Option 2** $-$ just report the actual *p* value and let the reader make up their own minds about what an acceptable type I error rate is.

But if you get *p=*.062, then it means that you have to be willing to tolerate a type I error rate of 6.2% to justify rejecting the null. If you personally find 6.2% intolerable, then you retain the null.

## Two types of errors

<br>

.large[
What about type II error rate? We care about this probability $\beta$ too. 


We refer to the **power** of the test, which is the probability that we reject the null hypothesis when it really is false, which is $1 - \beta$. 


A powerful test has a small value of $\beta$. Note we don't have a corresponding level for $\beta$.]

But statistical tests are designed to minimise $\alpha$, not $\beta$.

How have the authors in your paper interpreted the *p* values?

Spend 15 minutes putting together the 'Scientific background' and 'Hypothesis' slides.
