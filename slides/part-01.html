Foraminifera are single-celled marine protists. Some species thrive in **.blue[cool waters]**, while others prefer **.red[warm waters]**. By analysing changes in the  relative abundance of **.blue[cool]** vs. **.red[warm]** water species, we can infer past climate fluctuations.

It corresponds to the exact opposite of the thing we're testing!
]

--

.large[
The **alternative hypothesis** `\(H_1\)` is the thing we're actually interested in testing.
]

--

.large[
The goal is not to show that the alternative hypothesis is true, the goal is to show that the null hypothesis is (probably) false!

# Example

]

.large[
* **Alternative hypotheses** `\(-\)` θ &gt; 0.5 or θ &lt; 0.5, i.e., the proportion of **.blue[cool water]** species *has* changed.
]

--
.large[
The null hypothesis is what we'd except if there was no change from a stable cool period. Using a binomial test, we can check whether the observed frequency deviates significantly from the expected proportion (more on this shortly). 

Evidence in favour of the alternative hypotheses would provide evidence that the climate had shifted.

# Sampling distributions

.large[

]

--

.large[
We can also write `\(X/N\)` = 0.5. This is our **test statistic**.
] 

--

.large[
We need to determine what the **sampling distribution** of the test statistic would be if the null hypothesis was true. This tells us what values we can expect. We use this a tool to assess how closely the null agrees with our data.
]

--
.large[The frequency of a given species in our sample can be represented using a binomial distribution, where the values are the expected **.blue[cool water]** proportion.]

---

class: middle

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="img/samplingdist1.png" alt="" height="500px" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The null hypothesis predicts that `\(X\)` is [*binomially distributed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution).
It says `\(X\)` = 50/100 is the most likely outcome, so we'd expect to see somewhere between 40 and 60 **.blue[cool water]** species.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

## Critical regions and critical values

.large[
`\(X\)` should be very big or very small in order to reject the null hypothesis.]

--

.large[
If the null hypothesis is true, the sampling distribution of `\(X\)` is Binomial `\((0.5, N)\)`.
]

--

.large[
`\(\alpha\)` is the significance level (c.f. *p*-values).
]

--

.large[
If `\(\alpha = 0.05\)`, the critical region must cover 5% of this sampling distribution.
]

---
class: middle center

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="img/samplingdist2.png" alt="" height="500px" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Our critical region consists of the most extreme values, known as the **tails** of the distribution.

---
class: middle

.pull-left[

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

.large[
The **critical region** corresponds to the values of `\(X\)` for which we would reject the null hypothesis. 

The **sampling distribution** allows us to calculate the probability that we would obtain a given value of `\(X\)` if the null hypothesis were true.

.large[
For `\(\alpha =\)` .05, our critical regions correspond to  `\(X ≤\)` 40 and `\(X≥\)` 60.

The numbers 40 and 60 are our **critical values**.

If the number of **.blue[cool water]** species is between 41 and 59, then we should retain the null hypothesis.

If the number of **.blue[cool water]** species is between 0 to 40 *or* between 60 to 100, then we can reject the null hypothesis `\(-\)` this is a **two tailed test**.

&lt;br&gt;

# Statisical significance

.large[
If the data allow us to reject the null hypothesis, we say that "the result is statistically significant", which is often shortened to "the result is significant". 

This terminology reflects a time when "significant" meant something like "indicated", rather than its more recent meaning, which is closer to "important".

How do we define significance?

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

# Two types of errors

.large[
We **always** have to accept there's a chance that the results of any test might be wrong.]

--

.large[
The goal behind statistical hypothesis testing is not to *eliminate* but to *minimize* errors.
]

---
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

# Two types of errors

.large[
After we run the test, one of four things might have happened:

* `\(H_0\)` is **true** and we *correctly accept* the null

* `\(H_0\)` is **true** and we *incorrectly reject* the null (type I error)

* `\(H_0\)` is **false** and we *correctly reject* the null

* `\(H_0\)` is **false** and we *incorrectly accept* the null (type II error)
]

---
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

# Two types of errors

.large[
If we reject a null hypothesis that is actually true, then we have a **type I error**.
]

--

.large[
If we retain the null hypothesis that is actually false, then we have a **type II error**.
]

--

.large[
One of the most important aspects of hypothesis testing is to control the probability `\(\alpha\)` of a **type I error**. ]

--

.large[
`\(\alpha\)` is called the significance level. By convention we often use `\(\alpha\)` of 0.05, 0.01, 0.001.]

--

.large[
A hypothesis test that is said to have a significance level `\(\alpha\)`, has a type I error rate is no larger than `\(\alpha\)`.

# *p*-values

.pull-left[

.large[
*p* can be defined to be the smallest type I error rate `\(\alpha\)` that you are willing to tolerate if you want to reject the null hypothesis.

In the foram example, `\(X=\)` 62 **.blue[cool water] species** gives us 
*p* = 0.021. The results can be interpreted as shown in the table, given *p* = 0.021.

`\(X=\)` 97 **.blue[cool water]** species would give us *p* = 1.36 X `\(10^{-25}\)`, which is a tiny, tiny type I error rate.

]

]

---
# *p*-values

.pull-left[

.large[

Recall that the critical region corresponds to the tails (extremes) of the distribution. 

*p* can therefore also be defined as the probability of observing a test statistic that is (at least) as extreme as the one we actually get. 

If the data are extremely implausible according to the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is probably wrong.

# Reporting *p*-values

.large[
**Option 1** `\(-\)` you can state only that *p* `\(&lt; \alpha\)` for a significance level that you chose in advance, e.g., *p&lt;*.05.

But this means we're being forced to treat *p*=.051 in a fundamentally different way to *p*=.049.]

--

.large[
**Option 2** `\(-\)` just report the actual *p* value and let the reader make up their own minds about what an acceptable type I error rate is.

But if you get *p=*.062, then it means that you have to be willing to tolerate a type I error rate of 6.2% to justify rejecting the null. If you personally find 6.2% intolerable, then you retain the null.
]

---
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

# Two types of errors

&lt;br&gt;

.large[
What about type II error rate? We care about this probability `\(\beta\)` too. 


We refer to the **power** of the test, which is the probability that we reject the null hypothesis when it really is false, which is `\(1 - \beta\)`. 


A powerful test has a small value of `\(\beta\)`. Note we don't have a corresponding level for `\(\beta\)`. Statistical tests are designed to minimise `\(\alpha\)`, not `\(\beta\)`.]

* Why is the goal of hypothesis testing to minimise type I - not type II - errors?

# Which statistical test should you use?

.large[

All statistical tests follow the same principles shown in previous slides but vary in the underlying details. You don't usually need to remember these.

Important things to consider when choosing a test: 
  * the type of data (variables) you have
  * what you're trying to test (e.g., comparison, correlation)
  * the assumptions the test makes about your data

# Data 

.pull-left[
.large[**Group exercise**]

Discuss the following:

* Data types
  * categorical vs. numerical
  * nominal vs. ordinal
  * discrete vs. continuous

* Can you think of an example of each one?
* What types of data are used for statistics in your paper? Make a note &amp;#x1f4dd;

# Published hypotheses

.pull-left[
.large[**Group exercise**]

Try to identify the following in your paper:
* The research hypothesis
* Statistical tests
* The alternative hypothesis
* The null hypothesis
* Do you agree with the authors?

Make a note to add your presentation &amp;#x1f4dd; 

Don't worry about getting it perfect, you can make refinements later as you learn more about the tests.
