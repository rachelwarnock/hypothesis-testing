# Reproducibility in cancer biology

.large[Aim: replicate (and reproduce) 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers.]

.large[In the end, they were able to repeat 50
experiments from 23 papers.]

.large[The problems:

* **None** of the 193 experiments
were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to repeat the experiment.
* Key descriptive details necessary for statistics available for only 4 of 193 experiments.
* Despite contacting the authors, they were missing data for 68% of experiments.]

# Reproducibility in cancer biology

.large[Authors were extremely or very helpful for 41% of experiments, minimally helpful for 9% of experiments, and not at all helpful (or did not respond to us) for 32% of experiments.]

.large[Once experimental work started, 67% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41% of those modifications could be implemented.]

In paleobiology we delve,<br>
To learn about the creatures that once swelled,<br>
But when we add statistics to the mix,<br>
Our students' frustration reaches its peak.

They count and measure and analyze,<br>
But the data just confounds their eyes,<br>
They long for fossils and ancient bones,<br>
Not p-values and confidence zones.

But fear not, dear students, don't despair,<br>
Statistics is a tool that's fair,<br>
It helps us find the truth we seek,<br>
And in the end, the answers speak.

So buckle down and crunch those numbers,<br>
And soon you'll find your knowledge lumbers,<br>
For in the intersection of these two fields,<br>
Lies the secrets that evolution yields.

*A poem by ChatGTP*
