# Reproducibility in other fields

.large[Aim: replicate (and reproduce) 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers.]

.large[In the end, they were able to repeat 50
experiments from 23 papers.]

.large[The problems:

* **None** of the 193 experiments
were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to repeat the experiment.
* key descriptive details necessary for statistics available for only 4 of 193 experiments.
* despite contacting the authors, they were missing data for 68% of experiments.]

# Reproducibility in other fields

.large[Authors were extremely or very helpful for 41% of experiments, minimally helpful for 9% of experiments, and not at all helpful (or did not respond to us) for 32% of experiments.]

.large[Once experimental work started, 67% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41% of those modifications could be implemented.]
