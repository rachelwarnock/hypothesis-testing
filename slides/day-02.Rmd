# Reproducibility

.large[
Requires that scientific papers provide sufficiently clear instructions to allow for successful **repetition** and **extension** of analyses.

# Replicability vs. reproducibility

.large[
**Replicability** — Obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question.

**Reproducibility** — Obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and analytical conditions.

But lessons in reproducibility are valuable even when you’re working alone or not doing something hugely complex! 

There are many reasons to benefit from the steps taken to ensure reproducibility.

# Benefits of reproducibility to the community

.large[
* Saves time, effort and money. 

* Increases transparency, helps others find mistakes.

* Increases scientific integrity.

* It makes science more accessible and equitable.

* Many funding agencies / journals have requirements.

# Benefits of reproducibility to **you**

.large[
* At an absolute minimum you should be able to reproduce the results yourself.

* Part of ensuring reproducibility is doing future you a favour.

* If you can routinely reuse data and code with ease, you can save a lot of time.
