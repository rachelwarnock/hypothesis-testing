# Course description

This course focuses on statistical **hypothesis testing** and **reproducibility** in science. 
You will learn how develop and test your own hypotheses, perform basic statistical tests and apply this knowledge to reproduce (and potentially improve) published results. There will be a combination of lectures and group exercises. 

The main part of this course will take place **10-12 April 10:00-17:00** in person at Henke Str.
We will finish at 17:00 at the *latest* each day and there will be plenty of breaks.

Each student is assigned to a working [group](groups.html) and each group is assigned a published scientific paper.

\

# Before the course

1. Read the paper assigned to your working group.
2. Complete the [Teacup Giraffe](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/) exercises, 1 through 6. 
3. Read up on different types of [statistical variables](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/types-of-variables/). Pay special attention to the following terms:
    * quantitative & categorical variables
    * discrete & continuous variables
    * binary, nominal, & ordinal variables
    * independent & dependent variables

\

# Course evaluation

The goal is to reproduce the results of a published scientific article.
Each group will present their findings on a date to be decided together.
You can use this [Google Slides Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_p1v3kD2eWrfU0uOmbvyE4iP0YD2_KRqfAuxwOLSMg/edit?usp=sharing) and these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfh-HZc3YM1HHnoTtw9s0O3vqZ89nuhaYFtsMmeCCQw/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare your presentation.

Note this course is graded together with Laboratory Methods in Palaeontology.
