# Course description

This course will take place **3-6 April 10:00-16:00** in person at Henke Str.
We will finish at 16:00 at the *latest* each day and there will be plenty of breaks.

This course focuses on **hypothesis testing** and **reproducibility** in science. 
You will learn how develop and test your own hypotheses, perform basic statistical tests and apply this knowledge to reproduce (and potentially improve) published results. There will be a combination of lectures and group exercises. 

Each student is assigned to a working [group](groups.html) and each group is assigned a published scientific paper.

\

# Before the course

Read the paper assigned to your working group and recap [the normal distribution](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/02_bellCurve.html). 

\

# Course evaluation

The goal is to reproduce the results of a published scientific article.
On the last day of the course each group will present their findings.
You can use this [Google Slides Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R_p1v3kD2eWrfU0uOmbvyE4iP0YD2_KRqfAuxwOLSMg/edit?usp=sharing) and these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfh-HZc3YM1HHnoTtw9s0O3vqZ89nuhaYFtsMmeCCQw/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare your presentation.

Note this course is graded together with Laboratory methods in palaeontology.
