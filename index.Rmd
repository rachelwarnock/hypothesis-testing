# Course description

This course focuses on statistical **hypothesis testing** and **reproducibility** in science. 
You will learn how develop and test hypotheses, perform basic statistical tests and apply this knowledge to reproduce (and potentially improve) published results. There will be a combination of lectures and group exercises. 

The main part of the course will take place in two parts on **16 Feb 11:30-17:00** and **22 April 10:00-17:00** in person at Henke Str. Group presentations will take place on **09 May 14:00-16:00**.

Each student is assigned to a working [group](groups.html) and each group is assigned a published scientific paper.

\

# Before the course

1. **Read the paper assigned to your working group**
2. Make sure you have a good understanding of the normal distribution (see the [Teacup Giraffes](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/) to recap some important terms)
3. Read up on different types of [statistical variables](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/types-of-variables/). Pay special attention to the following terms:
    * quantitative & categorical variables
    * discrete & continuous variables
    * binary, nominal, & ordinal variables
    * independent & dependent variables

\

# Course evaluation

The goal is to reproduce the results of a published scientific article.
Each group will present their findings on a date to be decided together.
You can use this [Google Slides Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z3RekIrHsS4-oqRluidL1kNbYLjBMT8CeUDf4szyPQo/edit?usp=sharing) and these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IJbtdQ-KDsJPKNBlwaGw7zQPG9BbBA9FGfKTNFFHbVk/) to prepare your presentation.

Note this course is graded together with Laboratory Methods in Palaeontology.
