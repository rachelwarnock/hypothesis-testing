# Course description

This course will take place **21-25 February 10:00-16:00** both in person at Henke Str. and online [via Zoom](https://fau.zoom.us/j/64375760834).
We will finish at 16:00 at the latest each day and there will be plenty of breaks.

This course focuses on **hypothesis testing** and **reproducibility** in science. 
You will learn how develop and test your own hypotheses, perform basic statistical tests and apply this knowledge to reproduce (and potentially improve) published results. There will be a combination of lectures and group exercises. 

Each student is assigned to a working [group](groups.html) and each group is assigned a published scientific paper (chosen by some of you).

\

# Before the course

Read the paper assigned to your working group.
